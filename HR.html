					<p>Hi everyone! In this project, I present insights gathered from reports on customer data to help
						manage and evaluate customer status. This addresses issues related to churn, performance, and
						revenue. It's also an opportunity to demonstrate my analytical skills, data workflow design, and
						data visualization expertise using Power BI.</p>

				<div class="inner columns aligned">
					<div class="span-4">
						<h2>Solutions</h2>
						<pre><code>
- High attrition among new employees (tenure < 2 years).
=> Action: Review and enhance training and onboarding programs for this group.

- High attrition in HR, often involving new or less experienced staff.
=> Action: Prioritize hiring candidates with more industry experience.

- Research Directors are frequently working overtime; leavers often struggled with the workload.
=> Action: Refine workflows and business processes to reduce workload and overtime pressure.
